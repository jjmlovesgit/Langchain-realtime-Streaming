To captivate and engage with your customers your LangChain application must stream its output back to user!  Nothing is more disappointing then LangChain apps that don't stream output.   If you want to blow away your customers, you have to code the streaming into the interface.  You worked too hard to stop short and give up on making your application stream!  We show you how and we share the code.

The StreamingGradioCallbackHandler is a custom callback handler that works with Language Models (LLMs) that support streaming. It's part of the langchain library and is designed to interact with the language model and handle events during its execution.  The combination of multithreading and the StreamingGradioCallbackHandler facilitates the streaming text effect in the Gradio interface. 

**Remember -- If your code does not stream, then your team will scream!**
